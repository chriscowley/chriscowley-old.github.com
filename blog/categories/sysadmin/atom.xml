    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent discussion/argument I had on Reddit got me thinking about the cost of solutions we put in.</p>

<p>In an ideal world everything would did have full redundancy, and the customer would never have any downtime. Everything would always be up-to-date and keeping it so would require restarting. The reality is very different unfortunately.</p>

<p>This potentially rambling post was inspired by someone accusing me of having &ldquo;a horrible idea&rdquo; because I suggested someone put pfsense on an Atom PC as a VPN router for a small office. He then proceeded to expain to me how you should always buy an expensive black box from a vendor (he didn&rsquo;t say black box if I am honest, I am interpreting), how you have to always have support on absolutely everything. I called &lsquo;bullshit&rsquo; and the whole thing went round in circles a bit until we both realised that were actually singing from the same song sheet, but from different ends of the room.</p>

<p>Having said that they could justify a lot. All our servers were clustered, storage was Fibre-channel, they had a 100TB 8Gb array for a team of 2 people who crunched monster video files all day. All that was justified expenditure, but they were not an internet company, so a bit of downtime could be justified. Even when we had a major disaster and a large swathe of Linux VMs disappeared from this world, nobody actually had to stop working and no money was lost.</p>

<p>A small business is not going to dump the money for multi-thousand pound Cisco router and a zero-contention synchronous internet connection. They may think that they need the best of everything, they may even be willing to pay for it if they have got enough of daddy&rsquo;s funding behind them. However that would be foolish, that money would be better spent on giving everyone a Christmas bonus.</p>

<p>Support contracts are another bone of contention. Now everything I have is under one, but that is not always necessary. I once needed to get a couple of TBs of storage into a large office asap. I happenned to have a few FC HBAs, a couple of old Proliants and a pile of MSA1000s in a cupboard. I built up a box with a pair of HBAs and a single MSA1000 and sent the whole lot up to the office with strict instructions that all the extras were for spares only. If something broke, no need for support &ndash; just swap it out. I figured it would be good for at least another 3 years. Especially as backups were pretty reliable there. Would a new SAN with expensive support have been more reliable, I doubt it. We would have to wait 4 hours for a new disk, rather than the 5 minutes a took to walk to the cupboard.</p>
