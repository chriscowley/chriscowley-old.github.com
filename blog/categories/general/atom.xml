<p>By way of a silly example, if I were to put a cake in the middle of my son&rsquo;s classroom, I can guarantee that the majority of the cake will go into the mouths of a few, while most will probably not get any. Why? They are children, that is why. However, if I give it to his teacher then she will make sure that it gets evenly distributed to everyone. She, like your staff, is an adult and she behaves as such.</p>

<p>This stuff may pay off directly (as in my VMware example), may be it won&rsquo;t. If you let people work from home, maybe at times you will wonder what they are doing. You will however have a happier employee. If that employee has no desire to go anywhere else, but wants to deliver the best they can for your company then you can only win.</p>
